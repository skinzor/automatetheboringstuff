# UnboundLocalError: local variable 'eggs' referenced before assignment


# This error happens because Python sees that there is an
# assignment statement for eggs in the spam() function
# and therefore considers eggs to be local. But because
# print(eggs) is executed before eggs is assigned anything,
# the local variable eggs doesnâ€™t exist. Python will not fall
# back to using the global eggs variable.
